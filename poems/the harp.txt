Only the music moved. Milks, feathers, skins,
names and smoke—nothing else was, neither night
nor the day, as the planets emerged from the music’s
eclipse to a rustle of music like drapery.
All at once hot and cold curdled into a drop,
the great press of the universe took form
in the lava, a mane in the ashes, dawn slithering down,
hardness transfigured itself into hardness
under the drizzle that once was a part of the sky,
as the diamond conceived its symmetrical frieze in the snow.
Sound grew primordial then,
a world’s lonely music
congealing and plunging and trying its changes: the meteor’s
shape, shapes of the harp and the zither, the silence, the stone.

Chile’s great seaboard, frozen into its winter,
washes the weeks in the rain.
Listen: that solitude turning to music again
as all seems to widen and fail past my knowing—
air, time, and the rains, a thing in the waves and the feathers.
And oblivion wakes for the harp.
