The Falconer and i 
When I was a child, I was a free-footed falcon.
Every man in the world was a skyscraper and I perched here.
My dad was a falconer, he wore a leather glove.
My life was free from bees, full of lemonade sun.
It was morning and the world was rising.

I love you but electricity can kill you.
I love you but light pollution drowns the stars.
I love you but birds must leave their nest
to know what it means to come home.

The bees are buzzing loudly now.

I am a falcon becoming a man,
my wings grow heavy on the ground–

So goodbye—
I learned to fly.
Goodbye—
I am burning in flight now.
Goodbye—
our pupils flood open to watch.

I fly, and fly, 
and it’s brilliant light 
and it feels so good,

I fly,
and I know 
electricity can kill me, but 
I don’t mind,

I fly, 
and light
becomes itself, 
multiplied 
and 
multiplied,

I fly, and they watch
as I
burst ––


a star dragging fire 
across the darkened sky.

Yet silence still lay upon the water at night. 
And dad, I’m not afraid of moving out anymore.
